    <p>i am mostly browsing youtube,so I have mention links to the favorite videos and channels related to my interests </p>

    
    <h4 id="music">Music</h4>
    <p>
        i mean who doesn't like music.mostly i listen to hindi songs but english is good too.
        my favorite singers are arijit singh,darshan raval,vishal mishra,arman malik and many more...
    </p>
    <p>
        My favorite instruments are guitar and flute.
    </p>
    <p>i also like to sing , i want to learn guitar but the devil named procrastination is not allowing me to do so.</p>
    <p>here's my spotify playlist &nbsp;<a href=""  target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-2x fa-spotify"></i></a></p>
    <p>This girl plays really good finger-style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIRYlAsSKk-Q6fNj9xiMG1A" target="_blank">guitar</a> </p>
    
    <H4 id="sketch">Skeching and Drawing</H4>
    <p>A major thing I am good at.In my school days if you will ask someone who is the best artist of the class,they would say my name </p>
    <p>I have won in many intra-school competitions and participated in many inter-school competitions.</p>
    <p>take a look at my &nbsp; <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4H16aihy4jFmeMfB7" target="_blank">skethes</a>
    these are very raw sketches,These are not even 1% of the total drawings I have made in my life, these are the ones that 
survived </p>

    <H4 id="memes">Memes</H4>
    <p>I see a lot of memes all day,I haven't opened a social media account to post photos but to watch memes.
        I am less interested in the  instagram memepages, i like the video memes more.You should laugh everyday as it is good for your health.doesn't matter
        what the source is.<p>I also watch stand-up comedy.</p>
        My favorite meme channels on youtube has to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MemerMan" target="_blank">Memerman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RockyMemes" target="_blank">RockyMemes</a>
    </p>

    <h4 id="physics">Physics and Astrophysics</h4>
    <p>my favorite subject among PCM is physics,when you are done with the problem and you see the solution it feels so cool,you feel smart.
         When you learn quantum mechanics it blows your mind,like how can something be a wave and particle at the same time?how
          can something behave like a particle in the presence of an observer but act like a wave in the absence of it? </p>
      <p> It is also  the subject which would humble anyone, I always admire the physicist who go deep into the subject , it is a subject which detaches me from the real world and makes 
        me realise that our existance just doesn't matter to the nature,It will exist the same way and we were created just by an accident.
